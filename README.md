## Baseline with React Class-Components

You're just getting your feet wet with React, time to jump in a bit deeper. This project will give you a great overview of what's possible with the basics:

- How do I get a component to render?
- How do I pass data to a component?
- When do I use a custom method?
- What is `.bind()`? 
- Why am I using `super`?
- Review of `.filter()` and `.map()` - how to use them in a component
- How does `state` work? What's it doing in the constructor?



## Set up for this project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
